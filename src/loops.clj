;;; FIXES:
;;; (v. 1.2-ansi)
;;;  2004-11-30 - Joerg Hoehle: a dozen small fixes to various functions
;;;  2003-12-16 - Tested a bit more, implemented FOR-HASHTABLE and
;;;               FOR-PACKAGES (FOR-PACKAGE) iteration CLtS-style
;;;               using (with-{package,hashtable}-iterator)
;;;  2003-12-16 - ported iterate-1.2 to ANSI Common Lisp (in the form
;;;               of SBCL). Extremely untested. Works for simple
;;;               examples, though.
;;; (v. 1.2)
;;;  6/14/91  - fixed generation of previous code
;;;  5/6/91   - improved code generated for COLLECT and ADJOINING
;;;  4/10/91  - added *binding-context?* to correctly determine when inside
;;;	        a binding context
;;;  12/20/90 - fixed ,. bug in IN-HASHTABLE
;;;  3/3/91 - no longer generates loop-end and loop-step tags if they're not
;;;           used, to avoid compiler warnings from some compilers (Allegro)
;;;  3/4/91 - treat cond as a special form for allegro
;;;  (v. 1.1.1)
;;;
;;;
;;; OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS & QUESTIONS:
;;; - What happens if there are two contradictory declarations 
;;;   about a variable's type?  We just take the second one. CLM 
;;;   doesn't say, but presumably this is an error. Let's say it is.
;;;
;;; - Is there a more general way to do synonyms that still allows
;;;   some specificity to particular clauses?  Right now, all we allow
;;;   is for the first words of clauses to have synonyms.
;;;
;;; - We should look at function type declarations, at least at the
;;;   result type, and record them.
;;;
;;; - Consider adding an if-never keyword to find...max/min
;;;
;;; - Consider allowing accumulation variables to be generalized
;;;   variables, acceptable to setf.
;;;
;;; - Consider parsing type declarations of the form (vector * integer),
;;;   to generate types for internal variables.
;;;
;;; - Vector destructuring?
;;;
;;;
;;; TODO: 
;;;  - do I walk &optional and &key code in lambda-lists?
;;;  - try binding *macroexpand-hook* in walk
;;;  - track down PREVIOUS bug in Symbolics and sparc lucid
;;;
;;;  - reducing and accum: RESULT-TYPE
;;;  - rethink types 
;;;  - how to type result var?
;;;  - (for var concatenate (from 1 to 10) (in '(a b c)) (next (gensym)))
;;;  -       (if (< var 10) 
;;;		 (next [from-to])
;;;		 (if lst
;;;		     (next [in])
;;;		     (gensym)))
;;;  - for var choose, for var repeatedly
;;;
;;; For CL version 2:
;;;  - variable info from environments
;;;  - macro info     "     " (so we can support macrolet)
;;;  - use errors for EOF
;;;  - change WALK and FREE-VARIABLES to take symbol macros into account
;;;  - array indices are fixnums
;;;  - type REAL for extremum clauses
;;;
;;; Maybe:
;;;  - decls can appear not at top level, as long as they appear before use.
;;;  - extremum and find-extremum should do reductions when possible
;;;  - optimize collections, hashtables, packages for lispms 
;;;  - fix :using-type-of to check for supplied ???
;;;  - for-in should allow numerical keywords (from, to, etc.)...?
;;;
;;;
;;; TO TEST: 
;;;  - leaving driver code where it is
;;;  - typing
;;;  - macroexpand & walk after-each
;;;  - check for duplicate keywords in defclause, defmacro-clause
